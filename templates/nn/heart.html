<span class="high-word high-head">Dataset Information</span> 
<p>
    This database contains 76 attributes, but all published experiments refer to using a subset of 14 of them.
     In particular, the Cleveland database is the only one that has been used by ML researchers to this date. 
    The "goal" field refers to the presence of heart disease in the patient. 
    It is integer valued from 0 (no presence) to 4. Experiments with the Cleveland database have concentrated on simply attempting to distinguish presence (values 1,2,3,4) from absence (value 0).

<span class="high-word high-head">Sigmoid Function</span> 
<p>
    The sigmoid function is used as an activation function in neural networks. 
    Just to review what is an activation function, the figure below shows the role of an activation function in one layer of a neural network. 
    A weighted sum of inputs is passed through an activation function and this output serves as an input to the next layer.

<p>
    When the activation function for a neuron is a sigmoid function it is a guarantee that the output of this unit will always be between 0 and 1.
    Also, as the sigmoid is a non-linear function, the output of this unit would be a non-linear function of the weighted sum of inputs.
    Such a neuron that employs a sigmoid function as an activation function is termed as a sigmoid unit.
