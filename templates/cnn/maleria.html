    <p>
        A Convolutional Neural Network (ConvNet/CNN) is a Deep Learning algorithm which can take in
         an input image, assign importance (learnable weights and biases) 
        to various aspects/objects in the image and be able to differentiate one from the other.

    <span class="high-word high-head">Dataset</span> 
    <p>
        This dataset contains two types of images of cells infected and uninfected.
        if image recognised is infected than the person is having maleria.
        <b>Yes we know spelling of MALERIA is wrong.</b>
    </p>
    <p>Train your own model by <a target="_blank" href="https://www.kaggle.com/iarunava/cell-images-for-detecting-malaria">downloading the dataset.</a></p>
