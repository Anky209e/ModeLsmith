    <span class="high-word high-head">ResNet</span>   
    <p>
        The problem of training very deep networks has been alleviated with the introduction of a new neural network layer â€” The Residual Block.
        <br>
        classical CNNs do not perform well as the depth of the network grows past a certain threshold. ResNets allow for the training of deeper networks.
